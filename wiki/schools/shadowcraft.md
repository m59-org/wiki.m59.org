## Shadowcraft

---

Shadowcraft is a school of monk and martial arts disciplines taught by a mysterious traveler in the Adventurer's League in Cor Noth...

A note on breath skills: they activate when resting, and being hit stops them for 4 seconds. So if you haven't been hit recently, you can rest and start them immediately. However, enemies can hit you and stop your breath skills. All breath skills that you have work together. You don't have to choose.

Shadowcraft skills will improve and work is a JoF is equipped.
