## Knightcraft

---

Kinghtcraft gains spellpower from heavy equipment. Plate, scimitars, helms, all contribute to Knightcraft. No self-respecting knight charges into battle wielding a dagger and leather armor. A knight's shield is required for any shield based skills.

Knightcraft is aligned with the Jonas faction.
The school leans heavily on Might and Stamina, but also has one skill each in Intellect, Agility, Mysticism, and Aim, making it the first school with skills from all stats.
