## Witchery

---

Witchery is a very unique school of spells and skills practiced by the witches of Biskalane. Their magic comes not from the Meridian, but through alliances with demons from realms orthogonal to our very existence. As such, their abilities are unlike anything seen in our lands. It is this fundamental difference that allowed their magic to survive unscathed through the cataclysm centuries ago, while many other lands and magics were forever changed.

Witchery’s spells are all Hexes, which are debuffs that do not do anything themselves. Instead, they react to other conditions on the afflicted target. For example, they may increase fire damage taken, or reduce outgoing damage from melee weapons. Witchery’s skills increase hex duration, increase hex effectiveness, or reduce hex mana costs, reduce hex vigor costs, or offer hex resistance.

Hexes have an inherent 'limit' in number. The default limit is one, meaning a player or monster that already has a hex will lose a random hex if another is cast on him.

Hexes tend to have a very high mana and vigor casting cost and long flat duration. Hexes all scale in effect based on caster ability and bonuses, as well as target Hex Resistance. Hexes inform the whole room when they are cast.

While Witchery magics are accessed through demons, those demons have ancient rivalries, and will not teach students from hated enemies.

Xaerdun, the demon of greed, has issue with Ventdal for her altruistic tendencies.

Those who draw power from an ancient pact with the demon Nequzon tend to favor magical combat and the untamed elements. Allies of Nequzon may not learn Iwodach magics.

Those who have learned from Iwodach draw their traditions from the ancient Biskalane battle witches. They favor scholarly knowledge employed through physical combat. Iwodach battle witches revile the careless passions of Nequzon followers.

Not all students of witchery are keen on harming others. The demoness Ventdal protected witches during their persecution, and she still protects those who forsake greed. She won't offer her power to followers of Xaerdun.

Nobody knows how to ally with the demon of sadism, Raumlar. His hexes are rare and powerful. (generally monster only hexes)

Spellpower is improved by aligning with Duke, as well as equipment such as Orc Shields, Daggers, and Skull masks. Arid Aria increases both hex resistance and hex effectiveness for listeners.
