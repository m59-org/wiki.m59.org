# Beastiary

---

Bestiary is a school of flora and fauna research & applied knowledge, which comes in many forms.

The creatures of Meridian can be charmed, spoken with, made peace with, antagonized, studied, and even commanded. By applying Bestiary, one can become a druid aided by beasts of the forest, a necromancer sending forth armies of the undead, or a hero leading troops into battle. Knowledge has no bias toward any of these ends. It is solely up to you.

Spellpower is very important for this school. It's possible for monsters to recover from charm attempts faster than you are applying charm if you aren't dealing enough damage, or if your spellpower is too low. Some of the charms are boosted by Faren's Mana Focus. Check their description to find out more.

Bestiary gets a spellpower bonus equal to +1 per 5 points of maximum vigor you have. This represents your biological willpower and capacity. If you have 80 maximum vigor, your bonus is +16. If you increase that by reincarnating into a sturdier race or by equipping gear with maximum vigor bonuses, your bestiary spellpower will also rise.

To charm a monster out in the world, a Bestiary mage must employ the proper attack spell for the creature's bio-type. For example, 'crawling charm' will charm an insect, but not an undead. Each attack with the charm spell will apply a spellpower-proportional amount of 'charmed' status, which lowers the damage the target deals as they lose the will to harm you. When the target has more 'charmed' status than remaining health, they will fall under your control, assuming you have enough Leadership.

Your capacity to command minions is determined by your Leadership stat, which is equal to your base maximum health up to 100. Your natural Leadership can go no further than that, but can be boosted by the Bestiary skills Willpower and Soul Domination, which can both double it, up to 400. They also double any Leadership bonuses you get from your gear. For example, a True Lute gives +15 Leadership. With 99% Willpower, that becomes +30, and with 99% Soul Domination, that becomes +60. Each monster has a Leadership cost to control, representing their power and utility as a minion, which you can determine with the Study Compliance spell. Monsters of similar level but disparate usefulness as minions will have very different Leadership costs. For example, an Air Elemental is only level 170, but requires 400 Leadership to control, due to its wildly powerful lightning bolts.

Monsters will also shrug off your charm at various rates. To secure a minion's loyalty, binding spells such as 'bind creature,' 'righteous authority,' and 'dominate will' can increase the time they serve you. Higher level binding spells can make a creature your minion indefinitely.

If your minion dies, you can save their body with a 'preserve specimen' spell and return to the Adventurer's League morgue to resurrect them. If you know the higher level spell 'vivify specimen,' you can do this yourself in the wild.

If you have bardic tendencies, your minions can enjoy the benefits of any of your Jala songs, provided they are close enough to hear them - but your enemies will also be boosted, so sing carefully.

If you are a disciple of Shal'ille, you can cast minor heal, hospice, and major heal on monsters. The same is true of followers of Faren and their Cauterize spell.
