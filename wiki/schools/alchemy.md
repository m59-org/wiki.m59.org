## Alchemy

---

Alchemy is Meridian's school of Item Magic and is an expression of the Natural Sciences in a world with magic. It is heavily based on Intellect and highly connected to civilization and the sciences. Its primary reagent is shillings, portrayed as actually transmuting the gold or purchasing alchemical supplies.


Alchemy books that teach spells and skills were thought to be completely lost to the ages. The last known alchemist was purported to be heading to Meridian by sailing ship, but he never made it...
