## Sorcery

---

Sorcery is a school designed to be useful to a huge variety of character types and situations. It has very strong themes of metamagic abilities - changing how spells work or how they are cast for the Sorcerer. The abilities aren't necessarily better, just different.
Those trained in this school can gain the ability to reserve a percentage of their mana to make their personal enchantments self-cast with no expiration timer (up 100% of the time) using the various Spirit Link skills. The reservation cost depends on the % in the appropriate Spirit Link skill and % in the spell being reserved.

* Spells 3-6 are learned from scrolls dropped in the Biskalane Desert and Maze *

Sorcery is aligned with the Princess faction.
