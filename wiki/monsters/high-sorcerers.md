You find this encounter atop the Ziggurat in the desert. They are intelligent and very deadly. You need high magic resist and high elemental resist if you hope to survive long enough to harm them.

Esh'Munamash, High Sorcerer of Life - heals and casts Purge and Dazzle.

Wisdom Awarded:

- Five of the High Sorcerers - 20,000
- Qua Kornedrin, High Sorcerer of Fire - 50,000
- Orbs = a lot

### Tactics
Killing the Holy and Unholy sorcerers first is currently the best strategy as they will happily spam Dazzle/Purge and Hold/Blind.

It's better to kill the Fire sorcerer last as he is harder to kill than the others. and his death triggers the appearance of the second stage of the encounter, the orbs.

After Qua'Kornedrin falls, you will then need to combat 5 spheres that cast elemental spell, include a heavy hitting Quake spell. They drop level 300 items. Once you have succeeded, you will have saved Biskalane... And earned a large amount of AW.
