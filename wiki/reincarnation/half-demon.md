## Half-Demon

---

Demons themselves are far cleverer and in tune with the mystic arts than humans. Demons tend to avoid direct physical combat, since they'd much rather curse you and watch you suffer. As for humans with partial demon ancestry, those details are private, though I'm sure you know how that kind of thing happens...

Half-demons carry some of the extraplanar abilities of their parents, including heightened capacity for intelligence and mysticism. This greater intellectual awareness comes at the cost of their physical bodies, which for full Demons were simply manifestations they made at will during the... act of parenting.

Half-demons make ideal mages, but it should be noted that their greater brainpower helps compensate in the areas of finesse and skill; although may be physically weaker, they can still dodge and aim as well as any full human. In addition, their partial extraplanar connection makes them mysteriously and naturally resistant to weapons made of nerudite.

REINCARNATING AS HALF-DEMON

If you have reached the proper state of enlightenment, you will undergo the process of reincarnation into a half-demon. This process will destroy all of your worn and held items, and you will forget everything you have learned in this life. You will be as a newborn, save a little wiser for your experiences.


For each reincarnation you have achieved, you will have one(1) additional stat point to distribute. When you reincarnate, you have a chance to choose your stats anew. Should you fail to choose at the time of reincarnation, you will retain one free stat reset that you can use by going to an Elder and saying 'change stats'.

Your guardian angel will never return once you reincarnate.
