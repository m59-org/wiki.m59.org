## Half-Undine

---

Undine is merely a categorization for a broad range of aquatic sentient races and water elementals. The half-undines that have begun to emerge are almost exclusively humanoid with sea-based colorization and the innate strengths of water. They are intelligent and agile, adapting to their surroundings quickly. However, their spiritual interests lie with the mysteries of the deep rather than the mysteries of nature, so they tend to have less mysticism than other races. They also rarely practice aiming, for, as they put it, waves need no aim to do damage.

Half-undine retain some of the eternal motion of the sea. Thus, uniquely among the demi-human races, half-undine resist a significant portion of containment magics.

REINCARNATING AS HALF-UNDINE

This process will destroy all of your worn and held items, and you will forget everything you have learned in this life. You will be as a newborn, save a little wiser for your experiences.

For each reincarnation you have achieved, you will have one(1) additional stat point to distribute. When you reincarnate, you have a chance to choose your stats anew. Should you fail to choose at the time of reincarnation, you will retain one free stat reset that you can use by going to an Elder and saying 'change stats'.

Your guardian angel will never return once you reincarnate.
