## Half-Orc

---

Half-orcs are built with the toughness of the caves. Resisting damage from scimitars and arrows alike, they prefer their battles up close and personal.

Half-orcs make ideal melee brawlers, but it should be noted that they have similar capacity to humans for knowledge and spirituality. Some scholars have pointed out that we should have noticed this long ago. After all, a decent percentage of their population become wizards by trade.

REINCARNATING AS HALF-ORC

If you have reached the proper state of enlightenment, you will undergo the process of reincarnation into a half-orc. This process will destroy all of your worn and held items, and you will forget everything you have learned in this life. You will be as a newborn, save a little wiser for your experiences.


For each reincarnation you have achieved, you will have one(1) additional stat point to distribute. When you reincarnate, you have a chance to choose your stats anew. Should you fail to choose at the time of reincarnation, you will retain one free stat reset that you can use by going to an Elder and saying 'change stats'.

Your guardian angel will never return once you reincarnate.
