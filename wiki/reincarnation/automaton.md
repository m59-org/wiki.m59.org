ON AUTOMATONS

Throughout the history of Biskalane, there have been many misguided attempts at immortality. The first and most obvious was that of fusing one's soul to a constructed chassis that naturally never ages. These automatons were mostly machine, and came with the drawbacks any learned mage might expect. The machine can be constructed to nearly any physical specification, but takes on no extra attributes regardless of the bonded soul's level of enlightenment. The truths of enlightenment are instead used in the construction of the chassis itself, improving resistances and durability.

Automatons live what many consider to be a tortured existence. They cannot experience many of the earthly pleasures of being alive, since they are not technically alive, yet they are subject to most harmful forces, since they are not technically dead. Numerous automaton shells remain stored away in the tombs and catacombs of the Sorcerers, because the first few fools to undergo the recreation process rightfully warned the rest against following suit.

Those who remain trapped in automaton form are indeed ageless, but should be pitied. Many remain rusted solid and unmoving in dark spaces under the earth for all time.

Automatons are artificial forms that cannot eat or drink. They cannot rest, and gain vigor regularly whether they are working, fighting, or standing still. Their rate of vigor regeneration is heavily influenced by their Enlightenments.


RECONSTRUCTION

You will not have any additional stat points to distribute, regardless of enlightenment level. When you reconstruct, you have a chance to choose your stats anew. Should you fail to choose at the time of reconstruction, you will retain one free stat reset that you can use by going to an Elder and saying 'change stats'.

Your guardian angel will never return once you reconstruct.

Automatons are unlike any living being. It is up to you to determine whether this torturous path is right for you.


RECONSTRUCTING AS AUTOMATON

To be reconstructed as an automaton, state thus:

I wish to reconstruct as automaton.

This process will destroy all of your worn and held items, and you will forget everything you have learned in this life. You will be as a newborn, save a little wiser for your experiences.
