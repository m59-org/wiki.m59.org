## Half-Elf

---

There are a great many races in the Sylvan tree of families. The tribe your people may be most familiar with are the Fey Elhai. Their eternal war against the corrupted Fey Dirhai is a sad thing to behold, but thus is nature. Life and death are locked in a cycle from which none can escape. It is for this reason that elves have stayed out of the affairs of most races.

Half-elves are gifted with greater potential for agility and aim. At the same time, they tend to avoid vast amounts of knowledge, preferring instead absolute mastery of a few key talents. Half-elves' ancestral history of shunning magic has led them to develop a variety of resistances to it in general, as well as a reduced capacity for mystical connection.

Half-elves make ideal dexterous rangers, but scholars have also debated whether half-elven inclinations lend themselves to fighting in the thick of things. After all, half-elves have lost none of the strength or durability of their human ancestors.

REINCARNATING AS HALF-ELF

If you have reached the proper state of enlightenment, you will undergo the process of reincarnation into a half-elf. This process will destroy all of your worn and held items, and you will forget everything you have learned in this life. You will be as a newborn, save a little wiser for your experiences.

For each reincarnation you have achieved, you will have one(1) additional stat point to distribute. When you reincarnate, you have a chance to choose your stats anew. Should you fail to choose at the time of reincarnation, you will retain one free stat reset that you can use by going to an Elder and saying 'change stats'.

Your guardian angel will never return once you reincarnate.
