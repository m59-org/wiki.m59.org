ON GNOMES

The third race found suitable for the soul-fusing process was actually one of the first the Merchant Princes of Biskalane encountered across the many oceans of the world. That alliance was prosperous and led to an era of rapid technological advancement. The gnomes were curious and quite adept with small mechanisms; possessing rather unique eyes, the gnomes were able to use Biskalane's offered resources to create never-before-seen devices and techniques.

Unfortunately, their curiosity led to political disaster. Using a new extraordinary ore sourced from a distant jungle island, the gnomes began to create equipment that was powerfully resistant to magic. The Sorcerers of that era created false reasons to cut off contact with the gnomes in order to hold on to the power of their magical hegemony.

All that remains of the gnomes in Biskalane now are the ubiquitous anti-magical shields that were mechanically mass-produced before the separation. Without genuine gnomish lineage to draw from, we may only reincarnate with portions of souls descended from human-gnome hybrids, thus the spiritual line is quite diluted.

However, certain advantages yet remain.

The gnomes were a small race, and depended upon technology. As a result, their physical prowess was extremely limited. They cannot rest to high vigor, nor can they eat much.


REINCARNATION

For each enlightenment you have achieved, you will have one additional stat point to distribute. When you reincarnate, you have a chance to choose your stats anew. Should you fail to choose at the time of reincarnation, you will retain one free stat reset that you can use by going to an Elder and saying 'change stats'.

Your guardian angel will never return once you reincarnate.

The gnomes are gifted in a way no other race can match. They are, however, extremely limited in other ways. It is up to you to determine how best to employ the gnomish traits.


REINCARNATING AS GNOMISH

To reincarnate as gnomish, state thus:

I wish to reincarnate as gnomish.

This process will destroy all of your worn and held items, and you will forget everything you have learned in this life. You will be as a newborn, save a little wiser for your experiences.
