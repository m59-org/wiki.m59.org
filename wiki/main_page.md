# Welcome to the new Open Meridian Project Wiki




## Open Meridian Project
We are The Open Meridian Project, a loose knit group of people working on a new expansion, and a new 3d client for the legacy MMO, Meridian 59.

Meridian 59 was first launched in December 1995, making it the first commercial 3d MUD. It is a skill based game, there are no levels in the traditional sense, and is known for an excellent PvP experience. It was open-sourced in February 2010 under the GPLv2. The artwork and some 3rd party licensed tools were not included.

Meridian 59 is based on old school '90s principles, characterized by hardcore PvP, open-world competition, and an avoidance of level, class, and treadmill systems. Rather, you will build your adventurer by exploring and playing with the skills and spells you like, growing your abilities independent of any artificial levels or classes. The unique fantasy world of Meridian 59 offers exploration, combat, and political drama.

**Long-term Goals**
- Continue expanding PvE content in Meridian 59
- Continue balancing and encouraging PvP
